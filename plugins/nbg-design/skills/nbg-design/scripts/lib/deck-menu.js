/* NBG Design — in-deck right-click menu: "Edit text", "Resize / move shape", "Export to PDF",
 * "Save edited copy".
 *
 * Inlined into every delivered HTML deck by add-deck-menu.mjs, right after print-layout.js
 * (which defines nbgPreparePrintLayout / nbgRestorePrintLayout). Plain browser JavaScript.
 *
 * Text editing
 *   - double-click a text element inside a slide (or right-click it → "Edit text") to edit it; a
 *     double-click on a shape or an image (no text under the pointer) selects it for resize / move;
 *     in place: the element becomes contenteditable (its inline markup and the slide's CSS are
 *     untouched; paste/drop insert plain text; anything the browser wraps around typed text
 *     other than the toolbar's b/i/u/s tags is unwrapped on commit); Enter or a click outside
 *     applies, Escape cancels, Shift+Enter inserts a line break; deck shortcuts are suppressed;
 *   - a formatting toolbar floats above the text while editing (draggable by its grip; double-click
 *     the grip to re-dock). Every control applies to the selected text when there is a selection
 *     and to the whole block otherwise: Bold / Italic / Underline / Strikethrough (semantic tags on
 *     a run), A− / A+ and an exact px size, font family (the design system's stacks), text colour
 *     (the NBG palette) — on a run these wrap exactly the selected text in a styled span, on the
 *     block they are inline style (line-height kept proportional) — alignment (block), Clear, Done.
 *     Block-level formatting is recorded as a 'style' edit. Shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+B/I/U,
 *     Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+> and < for size.
 *
 * Shape resizing / moving
 *   - right-click a card, photo panel, image, decorative block or text block → "Resize / move
 *     shape": a selection frame with eight handles appears (three for elements in normal flow,
 *     which can only grow to the right/bottom). Drag a handle to resize (Shift keeps the
 *     proportions), drag inside the frame to move, arrow keys nudge by 1 px (Shift: 10 px),
 *     Alt+arrows resize, Tab selects the enclosing shape, Esc / Enter / click outside finishes.
 *     Only the element's inline geometry (left/top/width/height, position for flow elements)
 *     changes; pointer deltas are divided by the slide's current scale so the artboard
 *     coordinates stay exact at any viewport size. "Reset shape" restores one element;
 *   - a shape toolbar (draggable) appears with the frame: X / Y / W / H fields, fill, border,
 *     corner radius, opacity, shadow (NBG palette), Reset, Done — all inline style on the element.
 *
 * Several shapes at once (text blocks, shapes and images alike)
 *   - Shift+click adds the smallest shape under the pointer to the selection (inside a selected shape it
 *     removes that shape — as in the SVG editor), Shift+drag on the slide
 *     draws a selection box (every top-level shape fully inside is added), Ctrl/Cmd+A selects every
 *     top-level shape of the slide, Ctrl/Cmd+click selects everything inside the shape under the pointer (its
 *     child shapes; a shape with nothing inside is picked alone, even a group member); the
 *     menu offers "Add to selection" / "Remove from selection" / "Select all shapes" as well. The
 *     frame spans the selection (each member gets a dashed mark), dragging moves all, handles scale
 *     all proportionally, arrows nudge all, the toolbar's style controls apply to all;
 *   - the shape toolbar's second row arranges: Order (bring to front / forward / backward / send to
 *     back — inline z-index computed from the siblings' effective stacking order, the parent made a
 *     stacking context when a negative index is needed; Ctrl/Cmd+] / [ with Shift for front/back),
 *     Align (left / centre / right / top / middle / bottom) and Distribute (horizontal / vertical,
 *     equal gaps) relative to the selection's own box or to the slide, Group / Ungroup
 *     (Ctrl/Cmd+G / Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+G). A group is logical: its members carry
 *     data-nbg-group="<id>" — recorded as a 'group' edit — and always select together;
 *   - nested / overlapping shapes: the menu lists every shape under the pointer ("Select at this
 *     point": nested parts, their containers, shapes behind — a text block inside a card included),
 *     the toolbar's Stack list offers the enclosing shapes, the selected one and its child shapes,
 *     Ctrl/Cmd+click on a shape with nothing inside cycles outward at the same spot, Tab / Shift+Tab step out / in.
 *
 * Printing (block v13) — the print path (Export to PDF, Ctrl/Cmd+P) hands nbgPreparePrintLayout
 *   rasterShadows: true (unless window.nbgDeckMenuConfig.rasterShadows === false): every blurred, non-inset
 *   box-shadow inside the slides is printed as a pre-rendered image behind its element instead of Chrome's
 *   luminosity soft mask, which macOS Preview / Quick Look / Safari mis-position (solid gray blocks); the
 *   deck is restored afterwards. See lib/print-layout.js.
 *
 * SVG editing (block v12) — the parts of an inline <svg> (icons, diagrams, charts drawn in the deck)
 *   - right-click an SVG → "Edit SVG" (or double-click the selected SVG, or click one of its parts in the
 *     Tree tab): the SVG gets a dashed outline and its parts — path, rect, circle, ellipse, line, polyline,
 *     polygon, text, image, use, g (nothing inside <defs>, <clipPath>, <mask>, <symbol>…) — become selectable:
 *     a click picks the innermost part under the pointer (through the selected part's frame too: a click without a
 *     drag there picks the part underneath, a drag moves the selection), Shift+click adds a part to the selection or
 *     removes it (through the frame as well), Ctrl/Cmd+click selects what is inside the smallest part under the pointer —
 *     a leaf alone; the members of a selected group when its frame is clicked — Ctrl/Cmd+A selects every top-level part,
 *     the toolbar's All button too,
 *     Tab the enclosing group, Shift+Tab the first part inside, the toolbar's Parts list any of them (drawing order);
 *     several parts: one frame spans them (a dashed mark per part), dragging moves all, handles scale all, arrows
 *     nudge all, and the toolbar's colours, width, opacity, order, Duplicate and Delete apply to every one;
 *   - the selected part gets a frame with eight handles: drag inside to move, a handle to resize (Shift keeps
 *     the proportions), arrows nudge by one SVG unit (Shift: ten), Alt+arrows resize. Geometry is written in
 *     the part's parent coordinate system: x / y / width / height on a rect or image without a transform,
 *     x / y / cx / cy / x1… on a plain move of text, use, circle, ellipse, line — otherwise a matrix()
 *     prepended to the part's own transform, so the path data itself is never rewritten;
 *   - the SVG row of the floating toolbar: Parts, X / Y / W / H (SVG units), fill and stroke (the NBG palette,
 *     None, Default), stroke width, opacity, the text of a <text> part (one run), Order (front / forward /
 *     backward / back — document order inside the parent; Ctrl/Cmd+] / [), Duplicate (Ctrl/Cmd+D), Delete,
 *     Reset SVG (as designed), Done. Fill / stroke / width / opacity are written as presentation attributes,
 *     or as the inline style property when the part already carries one;
 *   - every change is one 'html' edit record of the <svg> element (its innerHTML), so it persists, lands in
 *     the saved copy, is discarded with the slide and prints. Esc deselects the part, then ends the session;
 *     Enter / Done end it; a click outside the SVG ends it too. Reset SVG drops the record.
 *
 * Detachable panels: the shape toolbar, the structure panel and the assistant can be moved into a
 * window of their own (⧉ in their header): a Document Picture-in-Picture window where the browser
 * offers one (Chrome / Edge — always on top, movable anywhere on the desktop, closed with the deck),
 * else a pop-up window. The panel element itself moves into that window's document, so everything it
 * does still acts on the deck; closing the window brings it back. The text toolbar stays attached: it
 * works on the deck window's live text selection.
 *
 * The picker at the pointer: when the menu is detached into its own window, or open on a panel tab, a
 * right-click on the deck opens a compact menu at the pointer with the same "Select at this point"
 * hierarchy as the menu (front-most first, containers and shapes behind), plus Edit text; a click selects,
 * Shift+click adds, Esc / a click elsewhere closes it.
 *
 * One floating toolbar (#nbg-tools) with three tabs — Text (formatting), Shape (shape & arrange rows), SVG (parts) —
 * in a single panel with one grip, one ⚓ and one ⧉ in a side strip. One tab's row shows at a time: the tab of the
 * editor in use comes to the front on its own, a tab the viewer clicks stays in front until another editor takes over,
 * a tab whose editor has nothing to work on is dimmed but opens (idle row); a row's ✕ or the menu's Toolbars section
 * hides a tab (and the menu brings a tab to the front); the panel shows when any tab is wanted. Anchored toolbar: dragging it
 * anchors it — it opens at that spot from then on (ui.anchor.tools, per deck), shows ⚓; ⚓ or a
 * double-click on the grip releases it, and it follows the selection again.
 *
 * Toolbars (menu "Toolbars" section): each toolbar — text formatting, shape & arrange, structure /
 * HTML — is 'auto' (appears with the selection), 'on' (pinned: stays visible, idle when nothing
 * applies) or 'off' (closed with its ✕ or unticked in the menu; stays hidden until shown again);
 * the choice is remembered per deck in this browser. Every toolbar follows the selection: the text
 * toolbar formats the text being edited or, without an edit session, every selected text block at
 * block level; the shape toolbar shows the selection's geometry and style; the structure panel
 * follows the selection and the slide; a slide change drops an off-screen selection.
 *
 * AI assistant — the menu's Assistant tab (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L opens it; travels with the menu when detached; no separate menu item)
 *   - a request to an LLM, supported — each behind a checkbox — by a screenshot of the current slide
 *     (tab capture, our UI hidden, cropped to the slide), the slide's full HTML source with the deck's
 *     stylesheet, the selected element's source, and an image from the clipboard (paste into the
 *     request box, drop a file, or "Read clipboard"); embedded images travel as nbg-image:N
 *     placeholders and come back on apply;
 *   - a prompt picked from a drop-down (built-in ones, plus the viewer's own: add / edit / delete,
 *     stored in this browser) and free "additional instructions"; the reply is shown in the panel or,
 *     on request, replaces the selected element through the same path as the Code tab's Apply
 *     (same tag, sanitised, recorded — Undo in the panel);
 *   - the row popup (right-click a row of the structure panel — in the panel's own window when it is
 *     detached): a small movable dialog for one element
 *     with the request box, Answer / Replace, the prompt and the attachments; it stays open until the
 *     viewer closes it (✕, Cancel, Esc) — the status and the reply appear in the popup itself (Copy,
 *     Undo after a replacement, "Open in the assistant panel" for the full panel), and the assistant
 *     panel is never opened on its own;
 *   - providers: Anthropic, Azure-hosted Anthropic (Microsoft Foundry), OpenAI-compatible, Azure
 *     OpenAI, DeepSeek. Endpoint, model and API key live in this browser's storage only (the key
 *     optionally for the tab only) and are never written into the deck; nothing is defaulted — a
 *     missing value blocks the request with a message.
 *
 * Structure / HTML panel — the Outline and Tree tabs of the menu itself (toolbar </>, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O / H;
 * a structure tab pins the menu; the menu is detachable into its own window with ⧉, structure included)
 *   - Outline tab: only the shapes (cards, text blocks, images) nested by containment, with a
 *     checkbox per row for picking several, All / None, a text filter, kind icons, sizes, group
 *     badges; click a name selects it alone, Shift+click adds, Ctrl/Cmd+click toggles, Space
 *     toggles the focused row; the selection is highlighted on the slide and in the list;
 *   - Tree tab: the slide's elements (tag, id, classes, attributes, text previews), synced with the
 *     visual selection both ways — selecting on the slide highlights and reveals the row, clicking a
 *     row selects that exact element on the slide (Shift+click adds, double-click edits its text,
 *     hovering outlines it, arrows / Enter navigate); edited elements carry a dot;
 *   - under the Tree (the former Code tab; the API still accepts 'code'): the selected element's source,
 *     editable, below a draggable splitter whose position is remembered per deck (ui.split). Apply (Ctrl/Cmd+Enter) keeps the element's
 *     type, strips scripts / event handlers / javascript: URLs, and records the result as the usual
 *     'style' / 'group' / 'html' edits plus an 'attrs' edit (the other attributes as sorted JSON).
 *
 * Persistence and hand-back
 *   - every change is recorded as { path, kind: 'html' | 'style' | 'group' | 'attrs', original, value } and kept in
 *     localStorage under a key derived from the file, so a reload keeps it until saved/discarded;
 *   - "Save edited copy" downloads <name>-edited.html: the changes applied to a pristine snapshot
 *     of the deck taken when this script ran, so the copy loads exactly like the original — still
 *     self-contained, still carrying this menu; "Discard changes on this slide" restores the slide
 *     under the pointer only, "Discard edits" restores everything.
 *
 * PDF export
 *   - "Export to PDF" applies the shared print layout (every slide visible in flow, one
 *     1920x1080 page per slide, zero margins, backgrounds forced — exactly what
 *     scripts/export-pdf.mjs produces), opens the browser's print dialog, and restores the
 *     interactive deck when the dialog closes. The viewer picks "Save as PDF" (Chrome / Edge);
 *   - Ctrl/Cmd+P and the browser's own Print command go through the same prepare / restore.
 *
 * window.nbgDeck = { version, pdf: { prepare, restore, exportPdf }, edit: { start, commit,
 * cancel, isEditing, list, format, buildEditedHtml, save, discard, discardSlide, listFor, slideAt },
 * ai: { open, close, isOpen, view, send, test, settings, prompts, attach, clearImage, image, reply, apply, undo,
 * capture, hooks, lastRequest, providers }, shape: { select, selectMany,
 * add, remove, toggle, solo, selectAll, deselect, selected, selection, reset, align, distribute,
 * order, group, ungroup, groupOf, shapesOf }, svg: { edit, end, isEditing, target, part, selection, select, selectMany, add,
 * remove, toggle, selectAll, parts, partAt,
 * set, text, geom, nudge, order, remove, duplicate, reset, box, ownerOf }, config, roots, resolveTextTarget, resolveShapeTarget } is exposed; window.nbgPdf aliases
 * the pdf part. An external driver (export-pdf.mjs, tests) sets window.__nbgPdfExternal = true so
 * the native print hooks stay out of its way.
 *
 * The menu, toast, selection frame and toolbars live outside the slides, so the print layout
 * hides them.
 *
 * Configuration (block v11): an optional window.nbgDeckMenuConfig object, set by the inlining script
 * BEFORE this file runs (add-deck-menu.mjs writes it as the first statement of the block), makes the
 * same editor work on documents that are not NBG decks:
 *   - root:  CSS selector of the editable region(s) — the "slides" (default '.slide'; nested matches
 *            are ignored; e.g. 'body', 'main', 'article', 'section.page'); an invalid selector throws;
 *   - mode:  'deck' (default) or 'page'. Page mode changes what does not apply to a web page: the
 *            print path uses the browser's own pagination (backgrounds kept, animations frozen, the
 *            editor's panels hidden) instead of the one-artboard-per-page layout, the assistant's
 *            system prompt and built-in prompts speak of a page, and the wording says page / section;
 *   - unit:  the label of one root in the UI ('Slide' by default, 'Section' in page mode);
 *   - title: the menu's header and the detached windows' title ('NBG deck' / 'Page editor');
 *   - aiSystem: replaces the assistant's system prompt.
 * Nothing else changes: the same edits, records, storage keys, saved copy and API.
