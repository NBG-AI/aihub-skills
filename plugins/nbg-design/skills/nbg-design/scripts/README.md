# NBG Design — build, verification & export scripts

Zero-dependency Node scripts (Node >= 18, no `npm install`) that make asset embedding
deterministic, add a browser-free quality gate, capture per-slide screenshots, and export
the finished deck to PDF. They exist because the hand-pasting of large base64 data URIs is
the step that silently breaks in headless / SSH / Linux runs — the model "approximates" a
photo with a gradient or substitutes a text/box logo, and with no display to screenshot,
the lapse ships — and because a PDF produced any other way (browser "Save as PDF",
`window.print()` at A4, Office round-trips) changes the deck's aesthetics.

All scripts resolve the bundled assets **relative to the script's own location** (the
skill root), never the current working directory — so they work from any cwd and on any
machine, as long as the **whole skill folder** (including `NBG-Design/assets/` and
`scripts/lib/`) was copied, not just `SKILL.md`.

Skills are commonly reached **through a symlink** (e.g. `<project>/.claude/skills/nbg-design`
→ the plugin checkout). Every script works when invoked through such a link: the one script
with a "run as CLI only when invoked directly" guard (`add-deck-menu.mjs`) compares real paths,
because Node resolves `import.meta.url` to the real file while `process.argv[1]` keeps the
symlinked path. `add-pdf-menu.mjs` remains as a compatibility wrapper for the same CLI.

## 1. Embed assets — `embed-assets.mjs`

Author the deck with `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders instead of inline data URIs, then run:

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/embed-assets.mjs" my-deck.html
```

- Tokens map to asset files by lower-casing and turning `_` into `-`:
  `{{PHOTO_STREET}}` → `photo-street.datauri.txt`, `{{LOGO_KNOCKOUT}}` → `logo-knockout.datauri.txt`.
- Available tokens: `{{LOGO_PRIMARY}}` `{{LOGO_KNOCKOUT}}` `{{LOGO_SMALL}}`
  `{{PHOTO_FIELDS}}` `{{PHOTO_HEART}}` `{{PHOTO_PARTHENON}}` `{{PHOTO_SKATE}}` `{{PHOTO_STREET}}`.
- Define each token **once** (e.g. a CSS `background-image: url("{{PHOTO_STREET}}")` class)
  and reuse the class, so the large URI appears only once in the file.
- Fails loudly if a token has no matching asset or the asset isn't a `data:image/` URI.
- `-o out.html` writes to a new file; default overwrites in place.

## 2. Verify the deck — `verify-deck.mjs`

Run this before delivering **any** deck. It needs no browser, so it works over SSH:

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/verify-deck.mjs" my-deck.html --strict
```

Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail.

**Hard failures (always):** unresolved `{{TOKEN}}` placeholders; any image referenced by
`file://` / absolute / relative / `http(s)://` instead of a `data:` URI; zero embedded
images.

**`--strict` also fails on:** fewer than `--min-images` embedded images (default 2); file
smaller than `--min-bytes` (default 200000) — a photo-less deck is the classic tell; bare
`>NBG<` / `>NPG<` text nodes that may be a text/box substitute for the logo lockup; a missing
right-click deck menu (section 5; `--no-deck-menu` only when the user declined it), the
older PDF-only v1.4 block, or a block older than the version the skill ships (re-run
`add-deck-menu.mjs`). A present-but-incomplete menu block is a hard failure in every mode.

## 3. Screenshot the deck — `screenshot-deck.mjs` (optional, needs a browser)

Visual check for hosts that have Chrome/Chromium/Edge. Writes one PNG per slide at the
required viewports so they can be read and inspected:

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/screenshot-deck.mjs" my-deck.html [-o <dir>] [--viewports WxH,WxH] [--slides 1,2,5]
```

- Auto-detects a browser (override with `--browser <path>` or env `NBG_BROWSER` / `CHROME_BIN`).
- Navigates slides generically: injects a shim (before the **last** `</body>`) that calls the
  deck's `window.showSlide` / `window.gotoSlide` if present, then forces the Nth top-level
  `.slide` to be the only visible one **in place** — so `.active` toggles, `.hidden` toggles,
  inline `display` toggles and stacked scrolling decks all work, and the deck's own
  viewport-fit scaling still applies to the capture.
- Counts slides by the exact class token `slide` (`slide-title` / `slide-footer` do not count).
- Default viewports `1366x768,1440x900`; default output `test_scripts/screenshots/`.
- **Exit codes:** 0 = screenshots written, 1 = error, **3 = no browser found** (a soft signal — fall
  back to `verify-deck.mjs --strict`, which is the mandatory gate on headless hosts).

## 4. Export to PDF — `export-pdf.mjs` (needs a browser)

Turns the finished, verified HTML deck into a PDF **without changing its aesthetics**: one
page per slide at the slide's own box (the 1920×1080 artboard = 20 × 11.25 in at 96 dpi),
zero margins, backgrounds and embedded images preserved, vector (selectable) text.

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/export-pdf.mjs" my-deck.html [-o my-deck.pdf] [--size WxH] [--selector <css>]
                                                        [--settle <ms>] [--timeout <ms>] [--browser <path>]
                                                        [--debug-html <path>]
```

How it works: the deck is opened in headless Chrome/Chromium/Edge and driven over the
DevTools protocol (`--remote-debugging-pipe`, so nothing to install). A shim
(`lib/print-layout.js`, the same code the in-deck menu inlines) evaluated in the page lifts
the **host layer only** — navigation toggles (`.active` / `.hidden` / inline
`display` / `[hidden]`), the viewport-fit wrappers (scaled `#deck` / `.slide-wrap`, fixed
`#stage`, flex centering), non-slide chrome (buttons, counters) — makes every top-level
`.slide` visible in normal flow, jumps CSS animations/transitions to their end state,
forces `print-color-adjust: exact`, waits for fonts and images, then prints with
`Page.printToPDF` (`printBackground`, `preferCSSPageSize`, `scale: 1`, page size = slide box).
**A slide's own CSS, size, fonts, colours, copy, logos and photography are never touched**;
a slide whose box differs from slide 1 is reported, not resized.

Flags:

- `-o, --out` — output path (default: next to the deck, same name, `.pdf`).
- `--size WxH` — force the page box in CSS px; use only when the deck's slide box is wrong.
  The default is the measured box of slide 1 (a 1280×720 deck yields 1280×720 pages).
- `--selector` — slide selector (default `.slide`; nested matches ignored). Only for decks
  not authored with this skill.
- `--settle` — extra ms after fonts/images are ready (default 400).
- `--timeout` — whole browser session (default 120000 ms).
- `--browser` / env `NBG_BROWSER`, `CHROME_BIN` — explicit browser binary.
- `--debug-html` — dump the prepared (print-layout) DOM for inspection when a page looks off.

Fonts: the PDF embeds the faces the browser resolved on the exporting host for the deck's
font stack (`pdffonts my-deck.pdf` lists them). With Aptos absent, both the screenshots and
the PDF use the same system fallback — export where Aptos is installed if it must appear.

Built-in verification (exit 1 on failure): PDF page count must equal the slide count; every
slide box must equal the page box. A mismatch is a defect in the deck (a slide with
`height:auto` that overflows spills to an extra page; an undetected slide is missing) — fix
the HTML and re-export, never add print CSS or resize slides to get past it.

**Exit codes:** 0 = PDF written and verified, 1 = error / verification failure, **3 = no
browser found** — deliver the verified HTML, say the PDF could not be produced on this host,
and give the one-line command to run on a host with a browser.

After a PASS, rasterise a few pages and **read them** next to the screenshots:

```
pdftoppm -r 72 -png my-deck.pdf pages/my-deck     # poppler; 1382x777 px per page at 72 dpi
pdfinfo my-deck.pdf                                # Pages: N, Page size: 1440 x 810 pts
pdftotext -l 1 my-deck.pdf -                       # text is selectable (vector), not a bitmap
```

## 5. In-deck right-click menu — `add-deck-menu.mjs`

Gives the people who receive the HTML in-place text editing and the PDF export with no tooling.

```
node "<skill-root>/scripts/add-deck-menu.mjs" my-deck.html [-o <out.html>] [--remove]
```

- Inlines one `<script id="nbg-deck-menu-script" data-nbg-deck-menu="<version>">` before the
  last `</body>`: `lib/print-layout.js` (the print-layout shim shared with `export-pdf.mjs`)
  followed by `lib/deck-menu.js` (menu UI, editing, persistence, saved copy, print
  orchestration). The deck stays fully self-contained (~150 KB more).
- Idempotent: re-running reports `already current`, refreshes a same-version block, or
  upgrades an older one (including the v1.4 `nbg-pdf-menu-script` block). `--remove` strips it.
- **Configuration (block v11).** Programmatic callers can pass a configuration —
  `addMenu(html, { mode, root, unit, title, aiSystem })` / `buildMenuBlock(config)` — which the
  block writes as its first statement, `window.nbgDeckMenuConfig = {...};`, before the library:
  `root` is the CSS selector of the editable region(s) (default `.slide`, top-level matches only,
  an invalid selector throws), `mode` is `deck` (default) or `page` (browser pagination on print,
  page wording, page-oriented assistant prompts), `unit` / `title` relabel the UI, `aiSystem`
  replaces the assistant's system prompt. `readMenuConfig(html)` reads it back; `already current`
  means same version *and* same configuration. The CLI has no flags for it: a deck gets the
  defaults, and re-running this CLI on a configured file replaces the block with the default one.
  The development workspace's `html-editor` skill is the CLI for arbitrary pages.
- The menu: NBG-styled panel (white, teal accent, Aptos stack) with *Edit text* (when the
  right-click landed on text), *Resize / move shape* (when it landed on a shape; *Reset shape*
  once that shape was changed), *Export to PDF*, and — once edits exist — *Save edited copy*
  and *Discard edits*, plus *Cancel*. Escape / click outside closes it; arrow keys move; deck
  shortcuts are suppressed while it is open; right-clicking a link or form field keeps the
  browser's native menu. 📌 pins it: it then stays open after a choice or a click elsewhere,
  keeps its place (a right-click elsewhere re-renders it for the new target where it is) and is
  draggable by its header (`menuDrag`, 8 px margin like `clampMenu`); unpinned, it follows the
  pointer again. **Tabs (v1.15.0):** the menu header carries *Menu / Outline / Tree* tabs
  (`menuTab`, `setMenuTab`, `MENU_TABS`): the structure panel (`#nbg-code`) is embedded in the menu
  (`ensureMenu()` appends it, `.nbg-embedded` hides its own header) and shown on the Outline / Tree
  tabs (`showStructure` / `hideStructure`, `.nbg-tabbed` gives the menu the panel's size and
  `resize: both`); a structure tab holds the menu open (`menuHeld()` = pinned, structure tab, or
  detached) and hides the pin. `openCode(el, tab)` → `openMenuTab(tab)` (docked top-right, or where
  the viewer dragged it — `menuPos`); `closeCode()` closes the menu; `codeIsOpen()` = menu open on a
  structure tab. The Toolbars section lists text / shape / assistant only. ⧉ (`data-action=mdetach`)
  detaches the menu itself — `detachPanel('menu')`, `'code'` and `'ai'` map to it — into a PiP / pop-up
  window, structure and assistant included; ✕ / Esc there reattach and close it. **Assistant tab:**
  the assistant panel (`#nbg-ai`) is embedded the same way (`.nbg-embedded` keeps its own view tabs
  but hides its title, grip, ⧉ ▾ ✕); `openAi(view)` → `openMenuTab('ai')`; `closeAi()` closes the
  menu; `aiIsOpen()` = menu open on the Assistant tab; the Toolbars section lists text / shape only;
  `aiSettings.pos` / `size` are no longer applied (the menu's size is remembered across tab switches
  in `menuSize`); nothing re-opens on load — the menu and its tabs open on request.
- **Edit text** / **double-click**: the whole text block (accent spans inside a title stay
  intact) becomes `contenteditable` with a teal outline; Enter or a click outside applies, Esc
  cancels, Shift+Enter inserts a line break, Ctrl/Cmd+Z undoes. Paste/drop insert plain text
  (`beforeinput`), and every element the browser wraps around typed text — other than `<br>`
  and the toolbar's `b/strong/i/em/u/s` tags — is unwrapped on commit; original descendants
  are tagged during the edit so they can be told apart. The slide's CSS is never touched, and
  the element's `white-space` and box do not change while editing (rich mode, not
  `plaintext-only`, which would force `pre-wrap` and re-flow the text).
- **Formatting toolbar** (`#nbg-text-tools`, a `.nbg-panel` floating above the text while
  editing; drag it anywhere by the `⋮⋮` grip — it is then **anchored**: `ui.anchor.text` / `.shape` keep the position per deck, the panel gets `.nbg-anchored` and a ⚓ button, `placePanel` opens it there; ⚓ or the grip's double-click release it (`setAnchored(null)` in `makeMovable`, which takes an `anchorKey`) and it follows the selection again). Every control is
  selection-aware: with a selection it changes only the selected run, with a collapsed caret the
  whole block. B / I / U / S on a run go through `execCommand` with `styleWithCSS` off (semantic
  tags; an un-bold inside a CSS-bold block arrives as a formatting span and is kept); on the block
  they toggle inline `font-weight` / `font-style` / `text-decoration`. A− / A+ (x1.1), the exact
  px size, font family (design-system stacks) and text colour (NBG palette) wrap exactly the
  selected text runs in `<span style>` (`wrapSelection`: text nodes intersecting the range are
  split at the boundaries and wrapped, reusing a span that already wraps just that run) or become
  block inline style (the block gets a unitless `line-height` equal to its current ratio the first
  time, so a px-fixed line-height does not collapse). Alignment is block-level. Clear removes the
  selection's tags and spans (`removeFormat` + unwrap) or returns the block to the inline style it
  had before any formatting. Done applies. `pointerdown` on the toolbar is default-prevented so
  the editable keeps focus and its selection; the size field and family select save/restore the
  selection around their own focus; the live selection is authoritative while the editable is
  focused. Shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+B/I/U (collapsed caret → whole block), Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+> / <.
  Block formatting changes the element's `style` attribute and is recorded as a `style` edit
  alongside the `html` edit; selection spans travel in the `html` edit; Esc restores both.
  Panels hide through `.nbg-panel[hidden]{display:none!important}` (a bare `hidden` attribute
  loses to the panel's `display:flex`).
- **Resize / move shape**: offered for the card, photo panel, image, decorative block or text
  block under the pointer (an element is a "shape" when it is positioned, has a background,
  border or shadow, or is an image; otherwise the text block is used). A fixed-position
  selection frame (`#nbg-shape-box`) with eight handles follows the element's bounding rect;
  flow elements get only the east/south/corner handles. Dragging converts pointer deltas
  through the slide's current scale (`slide.getBoundingClientRect().width / slide.offsetWidth`)
  and writes inline `width`/`height` (respecting the element's `box-sizing`) and, for
  positioned elements, `left`/`top` with `right`/`bottom: auto` so the top-left corner is pinned;
  a moved flow element gets `position: relative` offsets. Shift on a corner keeps the
  proportions; arrows nudge 1 px (Shift 10), Alt+arrows resize; Tab selects the enclosing shape;
  Esc cancels a drag in progress or finishes; the frame is hidden in the print layout.
  *Reset shape* restores one element's original inline style.
- **Shape toolbar** (`#nbg-shape-tools`, a draggable `.nbg-panel` that appears with the frame):
  X / Y / W / H number fields (artboard px for positioned elements, relative offsets for flow
  elements; a resize pins the top-left corner like the handles do), fill swatches (NBG palette,
  transparent, Default = remove), border select (Default / none / 1–6 px; a new border gets
  `solid` and deep teal unless a colour is set) with palette colour swatches, corner radius,
  opacity (%), shadow (Default / none / soft / strong), Reset (same as *Reset shape*), Done.
  Each change writes the element's inline style and updates the same `style` record as its
  geometry. Keys typed in its inputs are not treated as deck shortcuts. With several shapes
  selected, X / Y / W / H show the selection box (moving it shifts all, W / H scale all from the
  top-left corner) and the style controls apply to every selected shape.
- **Several shapes at once** (text blocks, cards, panels, images): Shift+click adds a shape to the
  selection or removes it; Shift+drag on the slide draws a rubber band (`#nbg-marquee`) and adds
  every top-level shape fully inside it; Ctrl/Cmd+A selects every top-level shape of the slide;
  Ctrl/Cmd+click picks the precise element under the pointer alone (a group member included);
  the menu offers *Add to selection* / *Remove from selection* / *Select all shapes on this
  slide*. "Top-level shape" = an element that `resolveShapeTarget` maps to itself with no such
  ancestor inside the slide, excluding layers that fill ≥ 98 % of the slide (backdrops). The
  frame (`#nbg-shape-box`) spans the union of the members, each member gets a dashed mark
  (`#nbg-sel-marks`, the primary one solid), the chip and the toolbar report the count. Dragging
  inside moves every member (`shift()`: absolute geometry for positioned elements, relative
  offsets for flow ones); a handle scales the whole selection proportionally
  (`scaleMembers()`: each member keeps its fraction of the union box; Shift keeps the union's
  proportions); arrows nudge all; Reset resets every member with a record. Modifier clicks and
  rubber-band drags are default-prevented and the following `click` is swallowed so the deck's
  own click handlers never see them; a right-click keeps the selection so the menu can add to it.
- **Stack picker** for nested / overlapping shapes: `shapeStack(x, y)` = the shape candidates
  (`isShapeCandidate`: a boxed element or a text block — so a text block inside a card is
  reachable here although a click resolves to the card) among `elementsFromPoint`, front-most
  first. The menu renders them as *Select at this point* items (click = select alone,
  Shift+click = add); the toolbar's `[data-a=stack]` select lists `ancestorShapes(el)`, the
  selected element and `childShapes(el)` (first shape level inside it), hidden for a single
  shape with nothing around or inside it; Ctrl/Cmd+click goes through `pickAtPoint()` — the
  front-most shape at the point, or the next one out when the current selection is already in
  that stack; Tab selects `parentShape`, Shift+Tab the child shape under the last pointer
  position (`lastPoint`) or the first child. API: `shape.stackAt(x, y)`, `enclosing(el)`,
  `inside(el)`.
- **Arrange row** (second row of the shape toolbar, `data-a` buttons):
  - *Order* — bring to front / bring forward / send backward / send to back (Ctrl/Cmd+] / [ step,
    with Shift to the front/back; *Bring to front* / *Send to back* are in the menu too). The
    element's siblings are ranked by their effective layer (`zKey`: negative z-index < in-flow
    content 0 < positioned with z-index auto/0 = 0.5 < positive z-index; ties in document
    order) and the target gets the next free tier (`tierAbove` / `tierBelow`); one-step moves
    push the neighbours out of the way only on a collision. `setZ()` writes inline `z-index`,
    adds `position: relative` to a static element, and — for a negative index — sets
    `isolation: isolate` on the parent when it is not already a stacking context (otherwise the
    element would sink below the slide background). No DOM re-ordering, so every recorded path
    stays valid; each touched element gets its own `style` record.
  - *Align* left / centre / right / top / middle / bottom and *Distribute* horizontally /
    vertically: computed on screen rects and converted through the slide scale; the reference
    is the selection's union box (default with 2+ shapes; distribute keeps the first and last
    in place, needs 3+) or the slide (`to slide` in the select; distribute spreads 2+ shapes
    with equal gaps to the slide edges). Shapes are ordered along the axis, ties by the other
    axis, then document order.
  - *Group* (Ctrl/Cmd+G) / *Ungroup* (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+G): logical groups — each member gets
    `data-nbg-group="<id>"`, recorded as a `group` edit (`{ path, kind: 'group', original,
    value }`, so it persists, lands in the saved copy and is removed by Discard); selecting any
    member selects the whole group (`expandGroups`), grouping a selection that contains groups
    merges them; Ctrl/Cmd+click or `solo()` picks one member.
- **Toolbar modes**: `ui = { text, shape, code, ai }`, each `'auto'` (appears with the selection),
  `'on'` (pinned) or `'off'` (closed), persisted in `localStorage` under `nbg-deck-ui:<pathname>`.
  `syncToolbars()` is the single place that shows or hides the three panels (`toolbarWanted`:
  text = editing or a selected text block, shape = a selection, code = on request) and is called
  from `startEdit` / `endEdit` / `setSelection` / `deselectShape` / `openCode` / `closeCode`;
  the old `show*` / `hide*` helpers delegate to it. Each toolbar has a ✕ (`setToolbarMode(k,
  'off')`); pinned toolbars render an idle state (`.nbg-idle`: controls dimmed and inert, a note
  such as "No shape selected" / "Select text, or double-click to edit", docked top-left by
  `placePanel(panel, null)`); the shape toolbar slides below the text toolbar when both are
  shown. The menu's *Toolbars* section (`tb-text` / `tb-shape` / `tb-code`, `tb-auto`) ticks
  what is visible: click = hide (`'off'`) or show-and-pin (`'on'`; the structure panel through
  `openCode`). API: `window.nbgDeck.toolbars = { mode, set, visible, sync, names }`.
- **Toolbars follow the selection**: `layoutTools()` / `layoutShapeTools()` re-read the selection
  on every sync. Without an edit session the text toolbar targets `textTargets()` (every selected
  element with its own text): `format()` routes to `formatBlocks()`, which applies the block-level
  variants (`toggleBlock`, `toggleDecoration`, `setBlockFontSize`, `setTextStyle` — all now take
  the element) to each target inside `withRecords()`; Clear restores the record's original. A
  document-level `MutationObserver` on class / style / hidden (our own elements ignored) drives
  `onDeckChange()`: an edit or selection whose slide is off-screen (`slideOffscreen`: display
  none, hidden, opacity 0, zero size, or outside the viewport) is committed / dropped, and when
  the visible slide changes the toolbars and the structure panel are re-synced; scroll, hashchange,
  popstate, resize and transitionend schedule the same check for decks that navigate without an
  attribute change. `codeSlide()` lets the slide on screen win over a followed element whose
  slide left the screen, so the Outline / Tree always show the current slide.
- **AI assistant panel** (`#nbg-ai`, menu *Ask the assistant*, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+L, or the *AI assistant*
  entry of the Toolbars section; `ui.ai` is `'auto'` = opens on request, like the structure panel;
  `placeAi()` docks it right, or beside the structure panel when that is open). Three views (`setAiView`):
  *Ask* — prompt drop-down (`AI_BUILTIN` + the viewer's `aiPrompts`, stored under
  `nbg-deck-ai-prompts`), request textarea (a `paste` with an image file attaches it; `drop` too;
  *Read clipboard* uses `navigator.clipboard.read()`), Attach checkboxes (`aiSettings.include`),
  Reply radio (`aiSettings.output`: `answer` / `replace`), Send, status, the answer with Copy /
  Apply to selection / Undo (`aiSetReply` keeps the raw text and renders it with `aiMd`: escaped, then
  fences, inline code, bold, italic, headings). *Prompts* — list with Use / Edit / Delete (own) or Copy to mine
  (built-in), an inline editor (name, text, mode). *Settings* — provider (`AI_PROVIDERS`), URL,
  model, API version (Azure OpenAI only), key with Show, key scope, Standard values, Save, Test.
  *Structure* — `renderAiStructure()`: the prompt for *Answer me* (`structure.askPrompt`), for *Replace this
  element* (`structure.changePrompt`) and the default attachments (`structure.include`). The popup
  (`#nbg-ai-pop`, `openAiPop(x, y, el)` from the structure panel's `contextmenu` on a `.nbg-tr` row)
  offers the request box, the Answer / Replace radio (which resets the prompt select to the matching
  default), the prompt, the attachments; `aiPopSend()` `selectSolo`s the element, builds the assistant
  panel if needed (without showing it) and calls `aiSend({ target, promptId, output, include, request,
  pop: true })` — the overrides leave `aiSettings` alone. The popup **stays open** until ✕ / Cancel /
  Esc (a click outside does not close it; it is movable by its header): the status and the answer are
  mirrored into it (`aiPopStatus`, `aiPopReply`; Copy, Undo after a replacement, *Open in the assistant
  panel* → `openAi('ask')`, where the `[data-ai=asked]` note and the same answer wait). The panel opens
  on its own only when the settings are incomplete (`openAi('settings')`). **Tree + source (v1.15.0):**
  the structure panel has two tabs — the former Code tab is the bottom half of the Tree tab
  (`.nbg-ctree` | `.nbg-csplit` | `.nbg-craw`); `setTab('code')` maps to `'tree'` and focuses the
  editor; the splitter drags with pointer capture, `ui.split` (the tree's share, default 0.55,
  clamped 0.1–0.9) is stored per deck in the `nbg-deck-ui:` record, `applySplit()` re-applies it on
  open, on the panel's resize (ResizeObserver) and on a detached window's resize; double-click resets.
  The source attachments go
  through `aiSourceHtml(el)`: `cleanOuterHtml` minus `<script>` elements (this editor's own block when the
  root is the body), `#nbg-deck-menu-style` and the runtime elements — otherwise a page-mode "Page source"
  weighed 300 KB of editor code and was refused. Both panels fold: `ui.fold = { code,
  ai }` in `nbg-deck-ui:<pathname>`, `setFold()` / `applyFold()`, `.nbg-folded` hides the body and lets
  the height collapse; `toolbars.fold(k, on)` in the API. Tree rows are `width: max-content; min-width:
  100%` so the row highlight spans the scrolled width, and the scroll containers style
  `::-webkit-scrollbar` so the bars are always visible (macOS overlay bars hid them); the panel itself is `flex-wrap: nowrap` — with `wrap`, a column flexbox sizes its line to the widest row and the panel clipped the body, which is why no horizontal scrollbar ever appeared.
  `aiSend()`: `aiCheckSettings()` first (no fallbacks — a missing provider / URL / model / key
  returns a message and opens Settings), then the text (prompt, additional instructions, the slide
  source via `cleanOuterHtml(slide)` + `aiDeckCss(slide, store)` — the rules the slide uses, read from
  `document.styleSheets` (root / body rules, style rules matching the slide or something inside it, the
  same inside @media / @supports; @font-face and @keyframes are named in a comment, not copied; the raw
  `<style>` text is the fallback when the sheets cannot be read) — and the selected elements' sources,
  all through `aiStripData()` (`AI_DATA_RE`: any data URI of 64+ payload chars, base64 or not, with
  parameters, in attributes or `url()`) into `nbg-image:N` placeholders, one store per request; text above
  `AI_MAX_TEXT` (300 KB) is refused with the per-attachment breakdown, which every error message also
  carries),
  then the images (`aiCaptureSlide()`: the `.nbg-capturing` class hides our UI *before*
  `getDisplayMedia({ preferCurrentTab: true, … })` opens the picker, and the first frame whose
  `captureTime` is later than the hide — at most six frames / 2 s — is drawn to a canvas cropped to
  the slide's rect × the capture scale; `aiNormaliseImage()` caps the longest side at 1600 px and re-encodes
  when needed), then `aiCall()` → `aiBuildRequest()` (Messages API: `<url>/v1/messages`, image
  blocks `{ type: 'image', source: { type: 'base64', media_type, data } }`, `x-api-key` +
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` for Anthropic, `api-key` for Foundry, always
  `anthropic-version`; chat completions: `<url>/chat/completions` or Azure's `/openai/v1/…` /
  deployments route, `image_url` parts with data URLs, Bearer or `api-key`) and `aiParseReply()`
  (text blocks / `choices[0].message.content`; a `refusal` stop reason and error envelopes become
  messages). *Replace*: `aiApplyReply()` unfences the reply, restores the placeholders and calls
  `applySource()` — the function the source editor's `applyRaw()` now shares (one root of the same
  tag, `sanitise()`, style / group / attrs / html records); `aiUndo()` re-applies the element's
  previous source. Keys: `nbg-deck-ai-key:<provider>` in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` (`keyScope`),
  never inside the settings object; a pre-profile `nbg-deck-ai-key` is migrated to the active provider on load.
  Per provider: `aiSettings.profiles[provider] = { url, model, apiVersion, keyScope }` (`aiSyncProfile()` keeps
  the active one current); `aiSwitchProvider()` (the form's provider change, `settings({ provider })`, or a
  differing provider on load) stores the current fields and loads the target's, blank when never entered. Remembered per browser in `nbg-deck-ai-settings` (`aiMergeSettings`
  validates every field on load): provider / URL / model / API version / key scope, prompt, attachments,
  reply choice, `view`, `request`, `pos` (`makeMovable`'s new `onMoved` callback after a drag; `null`
  when the grip's double-click re-docks) and `size` (a `ResizeObserver` records the corner resize's
  inline width / height; `aiApplySize()` restores it clamped to the viewport); the request box and the
  settings fields save on `input` (300 ms debounce), selects and checkboxes on `change`. Test hooks: `window.nbgDeck.ai.hooks({ capture, fetch })`
  replace the capture and the network call; `lastRequest()` returns what was built.
- **Detachable panels** (`detachPanel(k, target?)` / `reattachPanel(k)` for `shape`, `code`, `ai`; ⧉ buttons;
  API `toolbars.detach / reattach / detached`): the target window is
  `documentPictureInPicture.requestWindow(size)` when present, else `window.open('', 'nbg-deck-<k>',
  'popup=yes,…')` (null → toast), or a window passed in (the round-trip test passes an iframe's
  `contentWindow`). The deck's `#nbg-deck-menu-style` is `importNode`d into the window plus
  `DETACHED_CSS` (`.nbg-panel.nbg-detached` static, filling the window, grip / ⧉ / fold hidden); the
  panel element is appended to that document (adoption keeps its listeners), `.nbg-detached` added,
  `ui[k] = 'on'`; `toolbarWanted()` is true while detached, `placePanel` / `placeCode` / `placeAi` and
  `makeMovable`'s drag return early for a detached panel; `stools.ownerDocument.activeElement` /
  `ai.ownerDocument.activeElement` replace `document.activeElement` where the panel's inputs are checked.
  The window's `pagehide` (close), `closeCode()` / `closeAi()` / the shape toolbar's ✕ reattach; the
  deck's `pagehide` closes the windows. `aiCaptureSlide()` calls `getDisplayMedia` on the assistant's
  window when detached (that window holds the user activation; `preferCurrentTab` only when attached).
- **The menu**: `menuPinned` (📌 in the head, `data-action=pin`) makes `closeMenu()` a re-render
  (`refreshMenu()`: `renderMenu()`, `clampMenu()`, focus kept) unless `closeMenu(true)` — Cancel and Esc;
  a pinned menu ignores outside pointerdowns, scrolling and resizing (clamped), and `syncToolbars()`
  refreshes it so ticks and hints follow the selection; its keyboard handling only applies while the focus
  is inside it. `ui.menuFold` (per deck) collapses the Toolbars section behind a `nbg-subbtn` header that,
  collapsed, names the toolbars shown. `menuItemEl(button)` maps an item to its element (stack entry, the
  shape, the text block) for `pointerover` / `focusin` → `hoverEl()`. *Show structure & HTML* is one item
  (`data-action=structure`, `openCode(el)` on the panel's current tab).
- **Structure / HTML panel** (`#nbg-code`, menu *Show structure & HTML*, toolbar `</>`,
  Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+O / H; movable by its grip and by its header row — `makeMovable(panel,
  relayout, '.nbg-ch')` adds the header's empty space and the "Slide N" title as a second drag
  surface while buttons, fields and the tabs keep their own behaviour; resizable; docked right by
  default). *Outline*
  (default tab): `renderOutline()` walks `childShapes()` from the slide (shape candidates only,
  backdrops included and badged), one `.nbg-or` row per shape with a checkbox (`toggleSelection`),
  a kind icon (`shapeKind`: img / text / box), `shapeLabel()` (text preview, image alt, or
  tag.class), size, a per-slide group badge (`groupBadges`), an edited dot; *All* =
  `selectAllIn`, *None* = `deselectShape`, the filter keeps matching rows and their ancestors;
  twisties share the tree's `codeClosed` set. `setSelection()` now drops any element whose
  container is also selected (a move would apply twice). *Tree*: `renderTree()` renders the current slide
  (`codeSlide()`: the slide of the followed element, else the one at the viewport centre) as
  rows keyed by element path (`data-path`), expanded two levels plus the ancestors of the
  selection, twisties remembered per path; rows carry tag, id, classes (ours filtered), truncated
  attributes (data: URIs elided), a text preview, and a dot for elements with records. Sync:
  `codeFollow()` runs on selection / edit changes, `codeRefresh()` (one rAF) on records and on a
  `MutationObserver` over the body (our own elements ignored) so deck-driven slide switches keep
  the tree current; clicking a row → `selectSolo` (Shift → `addToSelection`), double-click →
  `startEdit`, hover → `#nbg-hover` outline, arrows / Enter navigate. *Code*: a textarea with the
  followed element's `cleanOuterHtml` (our transient attributes removed); `applyRaw()` parses the
  text into a `<template>`, requires exactly one root of the same tag, `sanitise()`s it
  (script / iframe / object / embed, `on*` attributes, `javascript:` URLs), then writes style,
  `data-nbg-group`, the other attributes and `innerHTML` and records each that changed —
  `style`, `group`, `html`, and the fourth kind **`attrs`** (`attrsOf()`: the remaining
  attributes as sorted `[name, value]` JSON; `applyAttrs()` reconciles). A dirty textarea is not
  overwritten when the selection moves (Apply or Revert first). Records are kept for
  descendants too, so earlier edits inside the element still replay in order.
- **Persistence**: edits are recorded as `{ path, kind: 'html' | 'style' | 'group' | 'attrs', original, value }`
  (child-index path from the root) and stored in `localStorage` under
  `nbg-deck-edits:<pathname>#<title>`; a reload re-applies them, dropping entries whose original
  markup or style no longer matches.
- **Save edited copy**: applies the edits to a pristine snapshot of the deck taken when the
  script ran (`DOMParser`; path lookup with a unique-markup fallback) and downloads
  `<name>-edited.html` — loads exactly like the original, still self-contained, still carrying
  the menu. **Discard changes on this slide** (`discardSlideEdits(slide)`: the records whose
  element lives inside the slide under the pointer — `slideAtPoint`, else the slide at the
  viewport centre — restored newest first and dropped) leaves the other slides alone;
  **Discard edits** restores the originals of every slide and clears storage.
- **Export to PDF**: commits any open edit, applies the print layout (every slide in flow, page
  box = slide box, zero margins, backgrounds forced, animations settled), calls
  `window.print()`, and restores the interactive deck — classes, inline styles, attributes and
  the viewport-fit scaling — when the dialog closes. Ctrl/Cmd+P and the browser's Print command
  use the same `beforeprint`/`afterprint` hooks, so any print of the deck is faithful.
- `window.nbgDeck = { version, pdf: { prepare, restore, exportPdf }, edit: { start, commit,
  cancel, isEditing, list, format, buildEditedHtml, save, discard, discardSlide(slide),
  listFor(slide), slideAt(x, y) }, code: { open(el), show(el), close, isOpen, tab, refresh,
  target, source, setSource, apply, revert, rowOf(el), outlineRowOf(el), filter(q) }, shape: { select, selectMany,
  add, remove, toggle, solo, selectAll, deselect, selected, selection, reset, align(kind, ref),
  distribute('h'|'v', ref), order('front'|'forward'|'backward'|'back'), group, ungroup, groupOf,
  shapesOf(slide), stackAt(x, y), enclosing(el), inside(el) }, resolveTextTarget,
  resolveShapeTarget }` is exposed (`window.nbgPdf`
  aliases the pdf part); an external driver sets `window.__nbgPdfExternal = true` to keep the
  print hooks idle (`export-pdf.mjs` does).
- Chrome and Edge honour the page's `@page { size: 1920px 1080px; margin: 0 }` in the dialog;
  the viewer only has to pick *Save as PDF* (keep Scale 100 %). Safari's `@page size` support
  is partial — the CLI exporter remains the deterministic reference.
- The CLI exporter prints the file on disk, not a viewer's unsaved edits: to get a PDF of an
  edited deck, export the saved `-edited.html` copy.

```

`<skill-root>` is the directory that contains `SKILL.md`. Shared code under `scripts/lib/`:
`find-browser.mjs` (browser locator), `cdp.mjs` (DevTools-protocol client), `print-layout.js`
(print-layout shim, browser JS, used by the exporter and inlined by the menu), `deck-menu.js`
(menu UI, text editing, persistence, saved copy, print orchestration; browser JS).
